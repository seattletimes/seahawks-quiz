I remember meeting Mr. and Mrs. Seahawk at the opening of Centurylink (then Qwest) Field.

(Seattle beat them twice that year but lost the wildcard game in overtime) We were fans during the strike year that they came in strong late in the season and the Giants were grateful Seattle did not make the playoffs. We were fans every time Seattle showed promise and were very upset at the referee calls in their first Super Bowl appearance. Up here in the white mountains if Arizina, we are surrounded by Cardinals and Denver fans. It is so gratifying the Seahawks have finally redeemed our devotion and shown true dynasty potential.

These trips were always awesome and a great family bonding time for us.\n\nMy father grew up in Seattle and lived on Queen Anne Hill.  He graduated from Queen Anne High (when it still existed).  So consequently, my brothers and I grew up Seattle everything fans.\n\nI now live in Bismarck, ND with my family.  I haven't been to the CLink since 2005 when we moved from Western Montana to North Dakota.  However, my kids both love the HAWKS now and we represent the 12's from the flats of North Dakota now.  Someday soon I plan to bring my kids and wife to the CLink to experience the sheer awesomeness of HAWKS Gameday.\n\nUntil then, we will continue to support the HAWKS from a far.\n\nIn addition, my two brothers are driving from Helena MT to Seatown for tomorrow nights opener as I type this.  Super jealous, but also excited for them.  They were also in attendance for the niner game in September last season, as well as both playoff games.  \n\nSo in conclusion, the HAWKS are a Beasley family affair.  Go HAWKS!",

I got into the Hawks at a very early age because both of my parents are from the Seattle area.  I was fortunate enough to be featured in the \"who's coming to the game\" article on seahawks.com for last season divisional playoff game against the Saints.  I at front Row in the endzone beneath the Hawks' Nest for that game.  I remember how cold and wet it was and it made the atmosphere even better.  I was asked a question in that article, what was my favorite Seahawks' moment, I answered that question with watching the Hawks won the NFC Championship the first time against Carolina.  It's safe to say I have a new Hawks favorite, and that was running around my Las Vegas apartment screaming like a child after \"the tip\" by Sherman and and pick by Smith.  My best friend and I watched the game together, his name is Blaine and he is a huge Niners fan. I will never forget him ripping of his Kaepernick jersey and laying face down on the floor for ten minutes expressing how much he hates the UNR product (as we are both UNLV Rebels fans).  This is what Seahawks football does to us 12's.  It engulfs us emotionally and makes us feel like we are a part of the team and it's the best feeling in the world.  I'm so proud to part of the best fan base in the entire world.  Loud. Proud. TWELVE.",

I think it was pretty early in Largent's career, since Jim Zorn was the QB, but watching Zorn that day spurned by love for the game.  It's been a lot of waiting and struggling as a fan to get to where we are now but makes our recent success that much sweeter.

The owner came over to us and wished us luck and told us that he would make sure we could leave without issue once the game got out of control. No need, the place pretty much emptied out by the mid point of the third quarter while the three of us stayed until the final play. Bar tabbed was covered by the owner. 12th Man flag flying today on our balcony overlooking Beaver Creek ski resort. Game on.",

But when the Seahawks returned the kickoff, something clicked,  and I danced with such wild elation that my German wife came sprinting down the stairs, worried I'd tripped or hurt myself - and was annoyed to find out why I'd actually woken her.

Only 2 teams wrote back the seahawks and Bucaneers. I somehow became a Seahawk fan and have NEVER looked back!!! I've got a signed photo on my wall of Curt Warner my hero when growing up and have followed the seahawks from England ever since! I also got to commentate on \nSuper Bowl 40 on TV for Sky sports in England which was amazing! I visited Seattle and saw us beat the Rams and also flew to San Francisco where we unfortunately lost narrowly to the 49ers! I have 3 young daughters (one of which cuddles a teddy of blitz every Seahawks game!) so trips to Seattle aren't on the agenda right now but I can't wait to come back and see some live Seahawks action! I watch every single Seahawks game live on TV in the UK whatever the circumstances. The season opener against the Packers kicks off at 1.30am Uk time so Friday at work should be good! When I visited Seattle everyone was so friendly and I really can't get over the sound the stadium generated! Can't wait to hear it rocking again this season!! I'm so proud of last seasons heroics and I really hope this season is just as good! \n\nGO HAWKS!!! ",

    "note": "First saw the Hawks on the UK Channel 4's coverage of the NFL in 1983/4. Think it was play off game against Miami. fell in love with them - the era of Largent, Krieg, Warner, Easly, Bryant, Brown. saw the great early promise of the Hawks in the eratly/mid 80s turn to despair over the next 16 years or so until the move the the NFC west that has seen the fortunes of this great team go from strength to strength. Social media and the internet plus access to many Hawks fans makes my fandom more interactive and more enjoyable. Looking forward to coming to Seattle to celebrate my 50th birthday next year and enjoying a trip to C-Link early in the season.",

I went on a holiday to Iceland and because Icelandair flew to Seattle that us where the second week of my break was going to be.  I got a ticket for a Seahawks game vs the Detroit Lions. I became a Seahawk on the Lions first offensive play. The wall of noise was like nothing I had ever experienced before. It was awesome and I knew there and then this is my team. We went 17-0 down but came back to win and I lost my voice!  Wow what an experience!  Every year since then it's been a holiday to rake in a home game and the next week an away game. A cool way to see America!!  Spent the Super Bowl in Seattle and what a night!  My scariest moment was wearing (at that time) my Hasselbeck shirt at Oakland. OMG - that was an experience!",

Started watching the Seahawks  right about when they came to the NFC. Haven't looked back. 2005 will always hurt and I still give people from Pittsburg a hard time (not such a bad place after all). Nothing was sweeter than the last Superbowl. Seattle was finally able to exhale. My co-workers and friends who have allegiances to other teams often tell me that they turned off the game part way through due to the lopsidedness of the game. I don't think the cheering ever stopped even for hours after it was over. Go hawks. Repeat 2014!!!! Hauschka!!!!!",

I was not really a fan of any sports until I moved to Seattle in 1999 and fell in live with the Ms and the Seahawks. I have to thank my father in law Roland Alberto for making me a Seahawks fan as he had been a loyal season ticket holder since 1976! My husband and I moved to Virginia Beach in 2003 and were the only token Seahawks fan in Virginia Beach until Super Bowl XL. I loved Hasselbeck,  Alexander, and Tutupu at the time.  We loved our 2013 Seahawks and  were so happy to see our Seahawks win in Super Bowl XLVIII! I'd like to think that my father in law helped make that happen, as he passed away a day before the NFC championship game with SF. So id like to think he helped our Hawks get to the Super Bowl!  We love Dangeruss, Sherman, the Beast and the rest of the LOB...but my favorites are Doug Baldwin (Filipino power!), Jermaine Kearse and Kam Chancellor! I love our Hawks! Beat those Cheeseheads tonight!",

Yikes!).  \n\nAfter years of not-so-good teams and moving around the country, my faith the Seahawks didn't waiver.  And for that, I, and so many others like me, fans old and new, have been rewarded the last few years under Pete Carroll with the ultimate prize:  a Super Bowl championship for a city and a region long whose sports teams were long associated with mediocrity.  Mediocre no more are these Hawks.  Never been a better time to be a fan of this team.",

I got to watch Largeant train, ill-fated Bozmania the day he arrived, and the players throwing boo balls at the replacement players. I was that little kid always at the gate and the rookie lunch line searching for autographs.\n\nYears of life now find me in Austrslia, and the wonders of technology allow me to see today's game live on TV.\n\nMaybe one day I'll actually get to a game! But until then, I've got great memories of watching the 2013 season with my dad!",

I moved to South Korea about a year and a half ago and have been watching the game by myself early mornings; then I got news that my family were moving from WA to the same city that I live in here in Korea. Now I have my family to watch the hawks with!  Im truly blessed to be a part of the 12th man here in Korea with my family and with other Seattleites as well!!  \nGoHawks!",

All my cousins and uncles really liked them (probably because I grew up in Anaheim and they played there a couple of seasons). \n\nI've always loved the Pacific Northwest even though I had never been there. And it wasn't until about 2 years ago that visited Seattle for the first time and fell in love with that city. I remember we watched a home Seahawks game and I realized that's needed to be part of the amazing 12th man!! The whole vibe and how the city becomes one on Sundays was pretty awesome for me!\n\nNeedless to say, I knew more players names on the roster in 3 weeks, than I had ever known for the Rams. I guess you can say that's when I really started appreciating football more. ",

    "note": "I *WISH* I was a season ticket holder! What a dream!\n\nIt's funny, the first time I went to an NFL game *AND* saw the Seahawks play live, was in December '95, when I was a senior in high school, living in South Dakota, of all places. My best friend, Jamie, had a wonderful aunt & uncle in Denver with season tickets on the 50 yard line. Since the Broncos were \"...*only* playing the Seahawks.\" that weekend, they offered me & Jamie the tickets!\n\nIt was relatively easy for J to take off, since she was a Sophomore at Black Hills State University in Spearfish, South Dakota. It wasn't nearly as easy for me; but, when she showed up in her Jeep Wrangler, parked in front of my high school, that Friday, at lunch, offering a road trip and FOOTBALL, I \ndidn't think twice!\n\nI went home \"sick\" from school, and had to call in \"sick\" to my after school \nand weekend job at a fast food place I usually worked 6p-close, 5-6 days a week, for nearly two years. They weren't used to having to find someone to fill in for me, but had a hard time arguing that I had plenty of sick time!\n\nLess than an hour later, we were on the road to Denver, Colorado! J's aunt and uncle were die-hard Broncos fans, of course; it was still the \nJohn Elway era, after all. So, I wore the jersey and fan clothes they lent me, and they threw us a terrific tail-gate party, especially after learning it was my first NFL game!\n\nStill, though I'd move around a lot, and had yet to even visit the Pacific Northwest, Seattle had been on my list of places to live, in the future, for years; so, though I'd have been pretty scared, at the time, to dress like a Seahawks fan amongst the throng of Broncos fans, I told J I was secretly rooting for the \"underdogs\". She said, \"That's cool, but PLEASE keep it a secret!\"\n\nFor the most part, I thought the Broncos fans were supercool people, and \nthe tailgate parties were outrageous! However, on our way in to the stadium, I saw someone holding a long stick with a fake, life-sized \nSeahawks player, hanging from a noose; I was REALLY offended, on behalf of the Seahawks, and strengthened my resolve to direct all of my positive energy to the 'Hawks!\n\nI didn't know ANY of the players; both of my parents had been born and/or raised in Texas, so I'd been raised a Dallas Cowboy fan, even though I'd never lived there. I WAS a diehard Cowboys' fan for a verrry long time. \n\nOne of the things I loved most about them? It was their constant ability to come from behind and win! The 4th quarter was nearly always my favorite, however nail-bitingly close, because when they had nothing to lose, they'd start bringing on the crazy and pull off a victory that would confound the other team!\n\nSo, on that bitter cold day in December, when the Seahawks were shut out for most of the first half, just finally getting a field goal before actually going into the half, I had and still have, a lot of faith in the power of the halftime locker room speech; I even think that *not* being ahead at the start of the second half, is one of the best incentives for a team to rally and get it together; to blow the other team's mind for the rest of the game!\n\nThe 'Hawks didn't disapoint...ME, anyway! Antonio Edwards scored their \nfirst touchdown, with an 83 yard fumble return in the 3rd quarter! They took control with THREE more touchdowns in the 4th quarter, to the \nBroncos' single 1-yd rush touchdown, by Elway, himself, and the Seahawks WON: 31-28! The Broncos and their fans were in shock, and I had to bite my tongue a lot that day!\n\nI had no idea that I'd actually end up in the Seattle area, but, I thought they were a team with a lot of potential, even then. Even when I did move out here, it was very difficult to let go of my beloved Cowboys, no matter how poorly they were doing.\n\nIt was at a Cowboys vs. Seahawks game watching party, that I vowed, in front of about 20-30 Seahawks fans, that whichever team won, I'd be that team's fan, from then on, and stop waffling. It was a crazy game; we had no idea who was going to win! But, the 'Hawks pulled it off! An interception with 5 seconds left and subsequent 50-yd field goal confirmed the win!\n\nAnd, I'll admit, I was actually relieved; I'm a loyal fan, so it was difficult to give up the Cowboys, even though I'd been living in the Puget Sound area for several years, by then. I WANTED to be a Seahawks fan, and rooted for them whenever they weren't competing with Dallas; but, it wasn't until after that game, when I boxed up every single bit of my Dallas Cowboys fan memorabilia collected throughout the years, and mailed it to a good friend and fellow fan, who was stationed in Germany, that I finally felt like I was the real thing:\nThe 12th Chick!\n\nOn another note, I picked Derrick Coleman as my favorite player, tied with Russell Wilson, because we share a disability: bilateral hearing loss. I lost most of my hearing when I was a year old, due to an allergic reaction to medication, and have had to wear hearing aids and take speech therapy most of my life. I love Coach Pete Carroll, and have since he took over the team, because he's such an optimist, smiles all the time, and really respects his team and the game...along with reminding the players how lucky they are to be physically blessed to play a game he was ultimately too small for. I have no doubt that he gave Coleman the opportunities to show what he could do, and prove he could start as full back. Coach Carroll is an amazing and inspiring man, along with owner John Schneider and most of the team they've built, including QB Russell Wilson and Full Back Derrick Coleman.",

Sadly my dad and uncles have passed away (but I know they're watching and cheering from Heaven) but my brother and I are both still very avid Hawks fans and always will be. Now my brother has two boys and they are now becoming Hawks fans as well!  We are not currently season ticket holders but if we could afford it - we sure would be in a heartbeat! I can't wait to take my nephews to their first Hawks game!",

The day before I was born my mother checked into Jefferson County Hospital in Port Townsend because she was pregnant with me and was close to the due date in December of 1984.  I remember my mother telling me when I was about 11 years old that while she was waiting to give birth to me, she put the game on KIRO radio and the call from the late, great Pete Gross and Steve Raible, who obviously calls the games today.  It would have been cool to have been delivered while the Seahawks were dominating the Detroit Lions that Sunday afternoon, but I wasn't born until very early the next morning.  Ever since then they've always been my team of teams (not trying to knock on the Mariners or Huskies because I root for them, too).  From the twilight of Steve Largent's career peak to the lean years under Ken Behring's ownership (and near-move to California) to Paul Allen's purchase & transformation of the franchise to what it is today.  Even after moving to Montana when I was seven years old I've never changed allegiances, not even to the hated Broncos!  I always have and will always remain a loyal & committed 12.",

I found the same thing in Seattle and fell in love with the city and so it was only a matter of time before I fell hard for their team. I started to watch football, I paid attention and I found that perfect balance of sportsmanship and enthusiasm that felt so familiar. I now follow every game on the Internet regardless of the time difference. I wear a jersey, I scream whenever there is a touchdown and I smile with pride every time I see something that is related to my favorite football team. Of course, I also danced during the whole Superbowl XLVIII and hope to do that again soon. Go Seahawks!",

But living here in Syracuse, New York, is what raised me a Jets fan (also green was my favorite color as a kid) but 15 years of heartbreak is not why I changed teams. Being a former Jets fan, I can relate to how difficult it's been for Seahawks fans over the years.\n\nThe Tim Tebow fiasco ruined it for me - it was then I realized the Jets had become a reality show, nothing but drama to fuel the headlines.\n\nSo why the Seattle Seahawks?  Because they have the best fans in the world. So while I am technically a new fan (who just happened to pick the right team at the right time) I have plenty of years ahead of me, still being just 27 years old.",

I started watching Seahawks games every Sunday and I was hooked! When I was a college junior, I'd still never been to a game in person, and my all-time favorite player - Steve Largent - was retiring, so even though it was finals week in Pullman, I took a Greyhound over the snowy pass and was at #80's last home victory (against Bo Jackson & the Raiders). Several years later, as a small-town TV reporter, I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Largent when he participated in a fundraiser for a local politician, and he was one of the kindest, most polite gentleman it has ever been my honor to meet. Each time the team has won the NFC championship, I've literally cried, and at the end of Super Bowl 48 I couldn't even talk. I even bought myself a set of rings in green, blue, & silver engraved with the team name, which I call my SB ring since I wore them for the first time on Feb. 2 as a sign of faith. I still have the recording from SB48 on my DVR, and somewhere I still have a #80 t-shirt that I wore 30+ years ago. ",

I really got into it and started buying all the merchandise I could and supporting as much as I could from London. I flew to Seattle especially for the Super Bowl and got to experience the sheer mayhem that is 12th man. Incredible scenes in Seattle I cannot think of any sports event in England to cause such jubilation I was so happy to be there and I don't think I will celebrate with such an amazing group of people ever again. That was it, and now I'm hooked! And as always GO HAWKS!",

We were way wrong! Last year I found a group on Facebook that held regular meetings at a local bar called The Auld Dubliner. I went and watched a game there one Sunday and was shocked at how many hawk fans came and cheered on the team! There's a good sized group of about 200 people and counting. When game time hits and the hawks start scoring, hell, you may as well name this bar the mini CLINK with how loud we are! Loud and proud member of the Tucson 12's! ",

However, Seahawks rallied in the second half, and only narrowly missed out on winning. The game ended 28-30.

Ever since I have always looked out for their results and was delighted when they won the Superbowl. ",

The fans, the experience, it is something I hold dear to my heart. My husband & I have been fans ever since, and he was never a big football fan. He was born in Germany, so the Seahawks have made him a football fan too. We hope to have another opportunity to go again, but until then, I am a California girl, rooting for Seattle everyday!!!

    "note": "My dad first taught me about football over breakfast at Sharis with saltines. We watched the Hawks every Sunday and now finally, I could understand what I was watching. My first game that I attended was with my mom at the Kingdome. It was back in 1991 and they were playing the Raiders. I'm fairly sure the Hawks list that game, but the Hawks hold many fond memories like that of bonding with my parents. Nowadays, it's something we all message each other about happily now that they're winning! I'm currently in Taipei, but I'm one of the 12s in Sacramento normally.",

    "note": "\nThe Seattle Seahawks, my hometown team, won this thing called the Super Bowl last weekend. And no, the Super Bowl is not a superbly packed bowl of marijuana (although I suppose it could be) or a bowl of mixed mint chocolate brownie and coffee ice cream. It’s the trophy won by the best team in the National Football League for each season. \n\nA Seattle City Councilman once said that sports provided zero cultural value to the city. The 700,000 people who showed up in Seattle on Wednesday, more than the city’s population, illustrated the importance of having a team like the Seahawks in their city.\n\nI moved to Seattle in 2001 after my father took a job with the Seahawks to be their Executive Vice President of Ballpark Operations, among other things. 2001 was also the year I turned 12 and started to go through that fun stage in life called adolescence. During my dad’s first season with the team, they played at the dingy Husky Stadium, and the Seahawks finished 9-7, missing the playoffs. \n\nAnd then finally, in 2002, the Seahawks moved into their new stadium, and the rest of the sports world could see the work my dad had put in to make the new stadium a brilliant place to watch a football game. My Seahawks pride burned as brightly as ever, with me mimicking the referee signaling first downs with my foam finger, and my sisters pretending they weren’t related to me.\n\nDuring the 2003 season, in a bid to bring back the passion the Seahawks enjoyed from their fans during the 1980s, my father led the charge to create a “12th Man” flag. On October 12, 2003, the big blue banner emblazoned with the number 12 was raised for the first time, and from then on came to represent so many different people from so many different walks of life. I don’t think my dad could have foreseen the impact his idea would have on the region at the time, but it’s one of the reasons I smile every time I see it.\n\nEventually, for my dad, it was time to move on from the Seahawks and his unfortunate falling out with his employers and wrongful termination soured my relationship with the team, as you might expect. Their Super Bowl run in 2005 was bittersweet for me. I was rooting for the team because Seattle is home, but it was also hard because they had recently fired my father. \n\nBut by season’s end, the wound had mostly healed. My dad and I went to the NFC Championship game that season to watch the Seahawks annihilate the Carolina Panthers on their way to the franchise’s first Super Bowl. The game that followed two weeks later was one of the worst sports-related experiences of my life. That said, I formed one of the best friendships I currently have with my friend Connor Folse, with whom I wrote an opinions article about how the Seahawks got screwed by the officials in that game. \n\nLet’s fast forward this a bit to 2011. By this time my father has been forced into retirement by a recent struggle with kidney failure, and has moved back to Seattle. The Seahawks finish that season 7-9, sneaking into the playoffs by virtue of playing in the worst division in football. Over my last winter break of university, I watched Marshawn Lynch complete that epic 67-yard run that caused not only literal seismic activity, but a real seismic change in how the city, and myself, viewed our football team.\n\nThat same year, I moved back to Seattle and started living with my dad. I requested Sundays off specifically so that I could watch football with him, because that’s what we did. Like pretty much any father and son, we bonded most when there was a game going on. I was especially grateful then to have the chance to watch games with him, as when he worked in sports I’d only get to watch half of the games with him.\n\nAs I think a lot of you know by now, my dad’s health situation has not improved. In fact, it has gotten worse and generally has been very difficult for my family and I to deal with. Football is incredibly valuable to us, it’s what brings us all together.\n\nThis Seahawks season was so special to me because of the people I got to spend it with, watching every week and yelling from the couch, skittles in hand. Even though I was living in DC, and my father was in Seattle, we’d still talk about the games, how we thought the team did, and we’d talk about his favorite player, Russell Wilson. \n\nDuring Christmas last year my family and I visited my father in his hospital bedroom. I’m sure most of you saw the picture of us together (it’s my default on Facebook and likely won’t change). Most of his gifts last year were Seahawks-related. He really does love this team. It was an emotional day for all of us. Spending part of your Christmas in a hospital is never anything you want, but on that day anyway I was very happy to do it, because we don’t know how many we’ll have left together. No one does, really.\n\nThe run the Seahawks made in the playoffs was special. The dramatic win versus the 49ers being the most prominent highlight of it, but the game versus New Orleans and the Super Bowl were also pretty neat. I just wished my dad could have been there watching these games with me. \n\nWhen the Seahawks won the Super Bowl on Sunday, the first person I thought of was my dad and how much it would mean to him. I was happy to later learn that he had been able to watch all of the game in spite of being in and out of being mentally aware. I wasn’t able to get a hold of him that night, and I really wish I would have been able to. He’s the person I’ve always shared moments like that with, and I really wanted to share this specific one with him. \n\nThe Super Bowl win was also a validation of the pride I have for being from Seattle. No one really pays us much attention, and we almost like it better that way. Any time we make a claim to being better at something than another place, the other side tries to put us back at the kids table. Well, we’ve grown up now. \n\nSeattle is a bit weird. We put cream cheese on our hot dogs. Our musicians got famous off of purple haze, teen spirit, big butts, and thrift shops. We don’t do orthodox. We’re the reason the rest of the country is hooked on caffeine. You may have heard of a computer company called Microsoft, they’re based here. Mayhaps you’ve ordered something off a little site called Amazon, they were created here. And then there’s this team called the Seahawks, and they have a running back whose runs are powered by Skittles and cause seismic activity. Our fans set records for noise at stadiums. It’s also where I really grew up.\n\nLast Sunday’s win was for my father, who has been through so much. The win was for my family, who have gone through a very tough year and needed the emotional lift of a Super Bowl. The win was for my sister Meredith and I, who watched nearly every game together. The win was for my friend Sam and I, who I watched every game but two with. The win was for my city, who had been wrongfully stripped of its basketball team, who had waited 30+ years for a championship many thought would never come. \n\nI think about it now, considering everything I just wrote, and it isn’t so shocking that the Seattle Seahawks are world champions. It really feels like we all earned it. That triumphant feeling will never really go away, either. I smile every time I think about it. And these days, I really need it. ",

Growing up seeing the Sonics stripped away, the Mariners fall short of ever reaching a World Series and watching the Seahawks fail to reach a Super Bowl until the 2005 season and seeing that taken away too, my friends would ask why I stay so loyal to such a mediocre sport town. The Seahawks made it worth the wait, brought tear to my eyes in February, and now those friends have become Seahawks fans. Pretty odd right? But Seattle will always be a baseball town to me no matter what and I still love my Mariners! MY OH MY!!!! I love my Seattle sports!",

Okay, it has to be a team in blue (my soccer team Ipswich Town are in blue). Where would I like to visit in the US? The west coast sounds great & then wow, what a stadium & amazing loud fans.

(The Mariners are still my #1 though).\n\nDoug Baldwin is also my Pinoy brother from another mother. ",

I saw two more games at Qwest in the 2006 and 2007 seasons and I hope to attend at least a couple of Seahawks games at Century Link in 2015.\n\nI'm also involved with the UK chapter of the Sea Hawkers Booster Club, I have been treasurer of the club since 2010. The main highlight as a Seahawks fan? It has to be that night in New York on February 2nd 2014! Go Hawks!",

There we were, a small group of Washingtonians gathered on the other side of the planet, in the pre-dawn hours, watching the game live. It felt like more than a game. More than a sport. More than simply a hometown team. Seeing this win brought a visceral connection, an intense emotion, a gasping release - of vindication. Largent taught me to run. Zorn taught me to throw. Bosworth cut my hair. Patera and Knox taught me emotion. The Seattle Seahawks aren't just a football team - they are family. Seattle is family (at least until the people from CA crowded in and stopped being neighborly). And when Family comes out on top, after all these years, you smile. Because it doesnt change what you knew all along, it just lets the world in our your little secret.\nAnd as I left the house that morning, under an Arabian sky where moisture is scarce and football nonexistent, the heavens opened and wept a Seattle drizzle, partly in joy, and partly in honor of those who, no matter where they are, are family.

That is when I became a 12. I have followed the Hawks through thick and thin. Seeing more and more Hawks fans around where I live I decided to create a group of 12s called the IE Seahawks. IE stands for the Inland Empire region of Southern California. The point is for fellow 12s from the area to gather together for games and whatnot. I also frequently post on a Facebook page called 12th Man Academy. The purpose of this page is to educate new fans on how to be 12s, and also teach history of Seahawks lore.  It's also a great site for other 12s who maybe just want to learn more about the Hawks.",

I was born in Nevada, lived in Palmdale until 1988 and then moved and lived in Lake Stevens WA until 2001. We loved going to the Kingdom for games and events. It was a sad day watching a childhood memory get imploded. It was several years before I went to Quest Field for the first time (an adult on a visit from SoCal in 2010). My love for Seattle and football runs deep. I was lucky to find a man who had no true football ties because now he's almost as big of a fan of our beloved Hawks as I am. Each year we get with other Hawks fans and root on our team. I know where to hang out to see a game in San Diego, LA, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Scottsdale. This year we are going to San Diego for the game and paid for NFL Sunday Ticket so we never miss a game. Go Hawks!",

    "note": "I was born 2/2/76 (Nice Super Bowl present). Grew up watching the Seahawks & 49ers, Steve Largent was my first sports crush, but also Joe Montana. Because they were in diff conferences I was allowed to cheer for both.  However, once we were moved to the NFC West, I followed the Hawks and had to divorce my 49ers. My boyfriend from N.California (Paraside, CA)came up for a visit and I took him to a SF / Seattle game here at C-link it was his first time seeing an NFL game live and his first look at C-link. that was 7-8 years ago. He is a fully converted 12 now and has adopted the team and fellow 12s.  The experiences at the C-Link were unreal and almost unexplainable... you just have to be there to see for yourself.  We were married April of 2013 and had little M&M's with wedding info and the hawks logo :) and as an early anniversary present, and my birthday present, the Hawks won the Super Bowl, my life is complete!  I worked for the Mariners from 91-99 and experienced the magical 95 season. I am grateful and so very lucky to be a part of and involved in those two pieces of Seattle History!  The Welcome home parade was painfully cold, but was it worth it. I've never ever seen that many people in an area like that and no fights, everyone was happy, smiling, energetic and friendly with all! Cannot afford Season Tickets, but schedule my life around the football season!  Thanks Seahawks, fellow 12s and the community for embracing and showing the rest of the nation that WE ARE HEARD here in Seattle.",

    "note": " I am 63 years old and a lifelong sports fan, particularly of the sports I grew up with—football, basketball and baseball. I was raised in the Seattle area and has lived here most of my life. As a kid, in the days before big time pro sports came to Seattle, I was an ardent fan of both the Seattle Rainiers minor league baseball team and the University of Washington Huskies football team of Jim Owens. Being tucked away up in the Pacific Northwest it may be odd but my real football love in those early sports years of the late ‘50s and early ‘60s, was the Baltimore Colts of Johnny Unitas, Raymond Berry, Gino Marchetti, Big Daddy Lipscomb and Lenny Moore. It was through watching and reading about them that I learned to love professional football. Growing up in a family of six kids it was never easy, but every time I could I would watch the Colts on the old family black and white TV, rabbit ears and all. There was as much excitement then watching that old antique as there is now watching the Hawks on a flat screen Hi Def. (It really is the game that counts.) When the Seahawks arrived in Seattle in 1976 I was an instant fan of the team, though at the time the Baltimore Colts of Bert Jones, Roger Carr and Lydell Mitchell were becoming good again and required an eye trained on them in the sports pages. When Baltimore owner Robert Irsay packed up the team and ripped it off to Indianapolis in the early ‘80s my Colts ties were severed for good, but by then I was bleeding Seahawks blue and green anyway. Like many Seahawks fans in Seattle, who have loved the team from the start and who pre-date even the “twelfth man” fanaticism of today, I have gloried in every high the team had, and suffered with every low; all of which makes this Super Bowl winning season sweet and something never to be forgotten. None of the 700,000 plus “twelves” who packed downtown Seattle on the Wednesday following our team’s 43-8 Super Bowl beat down of the Denver Broncos ever will. In 2014 let's do it again! Go Hawks!!

He was a Bears fan cause we lived in Chicago at the time but I wanted to have my own team. It was 1976 and two new teams came into the league that year. Didn't like Tampa Bay and always wondered what Seattle was like so I picked the Seahawks. Been a diehard fan ever since. This past year was the first year I got to see a game in Seattle and loved it!!! For my 60th birthday this year my husband got me an official helmet signed by Russell Wilson to add to my collection of Seahawks memorabilia in what he calls my \"she cave\" which includes warheads of Russell Wilson Richard Sherman Earl Thomas and Beastmode.\n\n Go Hawks!!!!!!",

I remember how bad it stung watching our Seahawks lose the Super Bowl during my freshman year of high school. Watching our Super Bowl season unfold this last year was a lifelong memory, and it's amazing to see the hawks affect an entire region of dedicated fans. This last winter I graduated from Western Washington University with Bachelors degrees in both Communication and Recreation. Just a few weeks ago my girlfriend Lauren and I moved to Colorado, where we are attending the University of Northern Colorado (just an hour north of Denver). I am pursuing my Masters degree in Sport Administration. This is my first time leaving Bellingham, and I have never seen so much Blue and Orange in my life. I have friends and family back home who ask me if I'll become a Broncos fan. I look at them in dismay. I know a true Seahawks fan could never do such a thing. Although I am living in a different region of our country, I will never lose my Seahawks spirit. There was no better feeling than walking to class last Thursday in my throwback Jon Kitna jersey and Seahawks hat. Here's to another season of Seahawks success, and hopefully another Super Bowl! ",

    "note": "I grew up in Southern Calif., thinking football was a violent sport with all the shoving & collisions. I didn't understand it at all but my Dad & I had a ritual of watching the Rose Bowl together every year. On January 1, 1978, I watched Warren Moon lead the Huskies to a Rose Bowl victory the day before I started my career at Boeing. That changed my life profoundly! I was so mesmerized by this dynamic QB that I started learning all that I could about this incredibly Nobel game. I saw that it was not necessarily a 'violent' game, but admittedly  a 'rough' one. It took several years before I could afford season tickets and I had to go on a waiting list. I used to call the Seahawks 'My Men' but I keep getting older, and they don't. So, now, I call them, 'My Boys'. My passion & loyalty for them is enormous; I never felt a fraction of school-spirit that compares to 12th Fan enthusiasm. So much of my life revolves around team awareness: whether it is studying player stats, reading blogs, comparing Seahawks' team stats to other teams' stats, watching any Seahawks related programming, buying Seahawks' related merchandise, Tweeting about them, etc. I even record home games so that I can re-watch games I've just been at. This is helpful on controversial calls and particularly good games. As far as their current level of excellence goes - well, it's been a long time coming. We are so fortunate to have the 3 elements necessary for success: Owner, GM, Coach, all with Vision and willingness to recognize what others fail to see.\n",

I loved the colour of our jerseys, our logo, the city and the stadium. My first favourite player was Shaun Alexander. I have followed them ever since. Even in those 10 years it has been a roller coaster of emotions with the greatest moment being our destruction of the Broncos in SB48. I am proud to be a Seahawks fan and hopefully one day I will be able to visit Settle and watch a Seahawks game. Go Hawks!",

One day I walked into a pub in a nearby town and there was a poster of the Space Needle and Seattle skyline. It was nearly identical to a poster which was in our school library years before. I knew at that moment I walked into that pub where my loyalties lie.I have never looked back.",

We the event staff who wear the blue and black polos  work our asses off and we get nothing to show for it. because we are ants at the bottom of a totem pole.  Adam Link is cutting all of our hours just so the full time staff can get their bonus at the end of the year.  Adam link took our year end party away from us and our bonus for working all the Seahawk and sounder games and we all park 3 miles away walk into work so then we stand for 8 hrs then walk back to our cars. which they can afford to have us park on the 6th level of the parking garage  but they won't let us because Adam Link just wants the money from the fans .We the Event Staff have a lot of complaints but no one listens to us because none of our new bosses and Adam link and paul allen  don't give a flying rats ass about none of the event staff. please seahawk fans next time you go to a seahawk game or a sounders game  you should thank the employess in the blue or black polos for our dedication to come to work and work our asses off. for no graditude from adam link.",

Now, working on a military base in North Carolina, merely mortal fans part like the Red Sea as I pass through crowds in my Seahawk hat, as I carry the might of our awesome defense and potent offense with me.

I am now a charter member and have tickets so I can share that experience with my family. I am proud to say I have been a Seahawks fan since back in the day, but really what this organization has done recently in terms of recognizing the 12th man is really what makes it different than cheering for any other team.  There is a true connection that exist between the club and the fans.  You feel that at the games and it makes it fun to be a part of.  Go Hawks!",

    "note": "it is easier told in pictures. but i can't do that so....basically my dad had me(5) and my brother(4) put on his xl mens jerseys and pose for a picture. I love that picture and that is when I became a fan of the seahawks, i would say. being around 13 now i have finally learned the basics of football and would root for the Seahawks over the Bears any time. I call myself one of the 12th man any time. when I was in Seattle this summer I went to the century-link field and took a tour. I love Seattle and want to live there and root for the Seahawks 4ever. And until then, whenever a Seahawks game rolls around i always have my (old) Seahawks jersey on!",

    "note": "Growing up in Washington you never had a team to root for. None of the big markets bothered to look at the small market team from the Pac NW. I suppose that's where the 12's get their chip on their shoulders just as our Super Bowl Champions have chips on their shoulders: we were always overlooked and dismissed as just getting lucky.\nWhen I met my husband 10 years ago, he wasn't entirely sure how to handle me. I yelled at the television louder than he did, I had a fish named Tatupu, and our son's first words were, \"Damn it, Holmgren!\" even.\nWhen the Hawks went to their first Super Bowl, we watched up in Bonners Ferry with my husband's parents. They weren't entirely sure what to make of the blue hair, Tatupu jersey wearing, yelling at the third team on the field (the refs), woman. My husband made sure that we never watched another Seahawks game up there because they were scared of his wife.\nLast season I predicted the scores of each playoff game (I was within three on each), and I even predicted the Super Bowl which my husband is still in shock over (not because we won, but because I predicted we'd score three ways and would score within the first 60 seconds, regardless of who had possession). This year I'm 1 for 1 on my score predictions (last week I said Green Bay would score first and fast, but they would be limited to 10 in the first half, they would score once more in the second, but the Seahawks would dominate the second half and win by more than two touchdowns). Once again, my husband gave me the look because even Vegas didn't have odds that specific. After the third quarter wrapped, he informed me I was a witch and I should stay out of Salem just to be safe.\nCheering from our living room for the Hawks is a family event. Our two sons join us (until they can't take the yelling anymore, then they watch the rest of the game in the basement), and it's....being a loud and proud 12th has connected us, via Facebook and Twitter, with other 12's around the world, and we've made many new friends because of it. Seeing all of the charity work the Seahawks players do only reiterates to us that we are cheering for a team that is more than worthy of being called world champions; they are champions off the field because of all of the charity work they do. \nWe are proud to root for the Seahawks, and even prouder to be a loud and proud 12's.\nGo Hawks!

    "note": "Years ago I loved watching Jim Zorn and Steve Largent, then family got in the way and I got side tracked until these last several years after Pete started to lead the team. What has inspired me about the Seahawks now is that they play as a team.  I have been carried along by my family who are all crazy fans.  I love watching with my husband, parents, kids, and grandkids.  For the superbowl we all sat and watched with my 83 year old father - I think it was one of his best days of the year. Now we are in Viet Nam so it is harder to watch live, and especially with family.  But we can still feel the spirit - all the way on the other side of the world. ",

I retired and moved to Ecuador a couple of years ago, but was fortunate to be able to still get some NFL games on my flat screen. When they slugged their way to the Super Bowl, I was watching at home and absolutely screaming like a wild banshee. Even though the commentators were speaking in Spanish, I didn't care, I was just so excited to see the game. Unfortunately, my Ecuatorian neighbors didn't quite understand what was going on with me, thinking that I had a medical problem, yet I tried in my best Spanish to explain that this game was similar to the 'Worlds Cup', and with that, they understood and joined me to watch the 2nd half. And when they won the game, it was like nirvana, people were hugging me and I was just on top of the world.  I just wish I was back in Seattle whooping it up with the fans there. I hope I and the rest of the Seahawk gang enjoy this again.",

I believe the Seahawks game was the second event (and first sports event) held in the Kingdome, having followed a Billy Graham crusade appearance.  Little did I know at the time that three decades later (in 2006) my wife and I would relocate to the Midwest and become one of very few locals to fly our Seahawk flag with pride outside our home, which is located midway between Springfield and and Branson in SWMO.  Most folks in this area are Chiefs fans...and we have taken quite a bit of ribbing (most of it good natured) about our PNW allegiance, but we will continue to be staunch Seahawks (and, BTW, WSU Cougars) fans for as long as the Good Lord allows.  Go, Hawks!!!  We try to never miss a Seahawks game at St. Louis..and, for the first time since our relocation, we will have two chances to cheer for the Seahawks in Missouri during the same season.

Later on in the 90's they would show the Super Bowl on tv so I could at least watch when the Seahawks played Pittsburg in SB XL.\nThen, three years ago the NFL started with their \"gamepass\" which gives access to all the games live and on demand. A new (old) world was back!! I found myself not only being able to watch the Seahawks but I can follow the whole league and regain my knowlege of all the teams and their players. I am a daily visitor to the the seahawks homepage all year long.\nLooking forward to the new season and my fall will be filled with football here in Sweden!",

I can't walk down the street without hearing a derogatory comment.  That said, it was all worth it last year during the NFC championship when Sherman tipped the pass and it was intercepted. You could literally hear a collective gasp followed by silence throughout the peninsula. It was a sound of silence that finally said we're for real...and then you heard me, my wife, and every other Bay Area 12 raise their hands in a V - \"we're going to the Super Bowl!\"... And this time we knew the Hawks would get it done.",

(brodcast in Italian, but the commentators weren't too bad, they knew what they talking about) silently screaming every score and big play so I wouldn't wake my family up. After an hour's rest I had to then get up to take my daughters to school the next morning. My wife thinks I'm crazy to stay up so late and follow the games even if I can't watch them live.

I'm also VERY superstitious to a ridiculous point. Ask my friends and family. Once we were losing when my granddaughter was visiting my place. She had never come over for a game. Because we were losing and she was the new thing thrown into the mix, I asked her to go stand outside. She stood out there and peered through the glass door with a smile on her face. Don't worry, she wasn't out there long. It is hard to pick a favorite player, they are all really my favorites. \nCoach Carroll too....so positive, full of energy and having fun at the same time.

It hasn't been easy especially being around Broncos territory, weeks before the Superbowl it was really hard with getting dirty looks and Bronco fans being downright arrogant.  Made it through with flying colors and   you could have heard crickets after Superbowl cause nobody said anything to me after that huge win!  Now with this yesterday nail-biting win over the Broncos,  yeah the Donkeys know who the Seahawks are and 12's like myself who will represent for the Seahawks even 1500 miles from home....GO HAWKS!!!",

Jermaine Kearse is a local and he's so reliable and he made my favorite TD play in the Super Bowl.",

When my husband relocated to Seattle, I told him I wanted season tickets for my birthday since I had never lived in an NFL city before.  He got the tickets when the Hawks were playing at Husky stadium.  We now have an 11 year old girl who attends game with us in the Hawks Nest -great seats and such a fun section.  I have been to so many great games, but I was skiing during Beast Quake because I didn't get a play off ticket.  Last year's NFC championship was amazing to watch from the Hawks Nest.  We then won the lottery for Superbowl tickets and went to  NYC to celebrate the Hawks and our 15 year anniversary!  Go Hawks, let's re-Pete.",

The 90's were tough years for us diehard fans, but in more recent years it has been a thrill to watch games and actually see how the 12th man affects the opposing team.

I was young at the time and did not understand the business. I was very upset and could not understand why the Steelers no longer wanted Franco. Franco signed with the Seahawks and I followed him there. I have been a Seattle Seahawk fan ever since. I know bleed Blue and Green. Its so funny because I have been wearing Seahawk gear for years. For the most part people would say to me \"Seahawks!\" they suck!! I had to listen to it for years. The other thing about wearing the Seahawk gear is many people either said they suck or never noticed. But now its all about when did you become a Seahawk fan, are you a bandwagon fan? Really? I have been here all along but you just now notice because they won Super Bowl 48. That is my story.",

My 2 daughters and I religiously put both our Huskies and Seahawks flags out on EVERY game day.  It irritates the heck out of my neighbors (both the Stanford & Cal fans as well as the 49er fans) but I am unwavering.  Very proud to be a 12th Man representing down south behind enemy lines.  Fun side note:  I bought my airplane tickets for the NFC Championship on Dec. 29 and my airplane and hotel tickets for the Super Bowl in New York on Dec. 30 because I was extremely confident in the team last year.  I even have the emails to prove it, which I proudly showed my 49er friends last winter.  :)",

I knew that I would be relocating back to the PNW, so I signed up for season tickets.  I had been told it would take awhile to get them. Imagine my surprise when Will called my from the Seahawks to tell me it was time to pick my seats that very year!!!  Now my dilemma of what to do!  I picked a pair of club section seats and then made a call to my cousin.  I told her I needed her help and that I had bad and good news!  I told her I was now the proud owner of a pair of Seahawks season tickets, that was the good news.  I then asked her if it would be a problem for her to go to every home game and to sell the extra ticket for the games I could not fly back for?  I think she is still to this day thinking I was crazy!  I flew home the first and second year for only one game. The next year I was so very lucky to come home for the last 3 games of the season!!  I then flew back to Virginia and it was time to drive to DC for a playoff game!  That was an experience of a lifetime, to only be followed by then going onto Atlanta.  I met so many 12s from all over and especially from home.  I then moved back to Bremerton and this next season began with a bang!  I attended every home game, including the playoffs and then was lucky enough to work it out to go with my cousin to the Super Bowl!  I do not think we can still believe it was real!  We are still riding high and I will always love the Seahawks no matter what the score of the game is.  They are my team and they play with all of their heart and soul and most of all they love the support that we as fans give them!",

Never once did I give up or lose hope we would become #1 in the NFL. Only QB I ever got to meet was Dave Kreig and all I could do was giggle. He was awesome and still shook my hand. I have supported every QB because they are core and lead our great team, now we have #3 Russell Wilson and he is such an inspiration to our team and community and not to forget our coaches.  We have had our share of them, but we have Pete and he has made us a NFL team that all us fans wanted. Last year was so incredible and enjoyed every week we played. Win, lose, or tie, my loyalty will forever be to our Seahawks. PROUD TO BE PART OF THE 12TH MAN.   ",

It came on progressively so I had time to play sports—and I’m a fan of all of them—but football is my true love. Playing while I could still see allowed me to learn the sport, so when I go to a game, I can hook on my radio and follow along as if I could see while absorbing the fantastic atmosphere you can only get at the stadium. I don’t have a favorite player; it’s all about the team. It’s the ultimate team sport. I share season tickets with my good friend, Scott Firch, and have only missed one home game since 2003. I’m a licensed massage therapist and recently moved my business to Federal Way. It took a couple of months, but I managed to snag a new phone number with 1212 in it—just one of my many Hawk idiosyncrasies. As they say, “It’s only weird if it doesn’t work.”  My prediction is a second Super Bowl win—I think we are that good.",

Lately, I've thanked heaven that I have Sunday Ticket.\n\nI've been luck enough to make it Seattle a couple times, and very much enjoyed watching the Seahawks dismantle the Vikings.  I was stunned that the place was actually louder than the MetroDome.  \n\nGo Hawks. ",

Some of the games that stick out (other than playoffs) were the win at Denver in 1984 on a missed kick by Rich Karlis, the win against Denvver at home in 1988 when Largent got redemption on Mike Harden, the heartbreaking loss to the Jets in 1998 and the phantom TD by Testaverde, a road loss at Baltimore in 2003 when we absolutely were shredding the leagues best defense, but couldn't get out of our own way, traveling to watch the win last year at Arizona when our fans basically took over the entire stadium... and the Monday night game last year vs the Saints when I got to take my own 8 year old to his first game and see the same look in his eyes, that I'm sure I had at my first game.

He said this is a new team that entered the league last year. They are  the Seattle Seahawks. I saw that Seahawk on the side of their helmet and that's all it took. I became an instant fan and followed the team ever since. I never thought I'd see the Seahawks go to the Super Bowl, but now I've seen it twice and we have a Super Bowl championship. The greatest day of being a Seahawks fan. I've seen the Seahawks play away many times, but never in Seattle. One day I'll make a trip to see them play at home. That will be a glorious day in my life.

    "note": "I was in the Navy in 1976 and since I was from Hawaii and we did not have a football team and the guys were always on my case, I decided I had to pick a team.  It just so happened that the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were forming up teams, so I picked the Seahawks.  So, I have been a fan for as long as they have been around.  As it turns out, 2 years later, I got orders and reported to a ship stationed in ... guess where?  Of course, Seattle!  I spent the next 7 years cheering them on through every game, whether they won or (mostly) lost.  That's what true fans do.  I was walking into the game between the Seahawks and the San Diego Chargers a few weeks ago.  Imagine if you will, a Chargers fan looks at my nice new shirt and throws out a comment about my being a \"fair weather\" fan!  Ha.  His memory could only go back so far...asked me if I even knew who Shaun Alexander was.  I shot back that I did and told him I even knew who Jim and Steve were and let him know I was a fan before he was born.  Credit to other Charger fans, they told the kid to just keep quiet and go watch the game.  Go Hawks!!!",

I traveled for a year around the USA after college looking for a combination of more high mountains to climb and beach to live on in a progressive green state. I decided to move to a very special and historic diamond in the rough town to go into business with no money. That was and still is beautiful Port Townsend.  It was love at first sight for me with those ugly birds but we had to push them into the King Dome for their first flight in '76. I feel privileged over the years to have the best seats in the house. I have been to both Super Bowls; enjoyed NYC on the first row in the second level behind Manning in the end zone as he had very quickly come to know that force before the first snap...the 12TH MAN! Our communities young and old feel the dynamic and galvanizing magic of The 12TH MAN which the rest of the sports world admires. Let's toast that our high flying Hawks remain the strong and hungry predators we all have come to love.  (With the relentless nurturing and feeding of The 12TH MAN, of course!)",

I grew up watching them anyway I could because we didn't get the Seahawks on TV in Pittsburgh but I still thought they were awesome, even in the darker times of the early 90's. \n\nWhen Seattle \"lost\" to Pittsburgh in Superbowl XL, it was very difficult for me around here in Pittsburgh because I wore my colors openly and that cause quite a few problems. Despite that, however, I remained true to the 'Hawks and always will be. \n\nI visited Seattle for the first time last summer and found the city to be amazing, fun, and exciting. My family had a great time. I hope to see it again soon. \n\nGo 'Hawks.  ",

Now I'm in college and far away from home, but I've got my Wilson jersey and I'll watch every game when I can, wherever I am. I still remember the last time the Seahawks were in the Superbowl, and how I had been dying to see them win. Ever since then I had been waiting and WAITING.

Low and behold who would be our QB but good ole #1 Mr. Moon.  I was hooked on the Hawks from that moment on and have never looked back.  Through the good times and the bad times, loved the Hawks.  Now it even brings me closer with my now adult son / daughter that are also avid Hawks fans, so its a family affair.  Go Hawks!",

In summer 2012, I moved to Louisville, KY for school and I was dreading it in large part because I knew it was going to be hard to catch any games. Throughout the season, I watched as many as I possibly could, sometimes staring at the ESPN gamecast waiting for it to update, other times using websites that were not exactly legal. Watching games has always helped me feel like I'm not too far from home.\n\nMy wife and I both love watching games in part because of all the cliche Seattle B-roll that they tend to show (guy catching fish, people walking into the original Starbucks, another guy catching fish, shot of Mt. Rainier, more people inexplicably catching fish, etc.). It reminds us of how beautiful Washington is and how it's the home of World Champions.\n\nWe are headed to St. Louis to watch them play the Rams this weekend. It's our early Christmas gift to ourselves!",

Retired after 31 yrs in the Navy, still following the Seahawks, but now with my wife and children from the other side of the country. Had my retirement flag flown all over the world... but also had it flown over the Seahawks training camp on opening day last year... the year I retired from 31 years in the navy and the first time the Seahawks won the Superbowl...

    "note": "The school i go to in Denmark, have a partnership with Edmonds community college in Lynnwood, WA. In October 2013, me and my class traveled to Seattle to study and live for two months. We lived with different host families and we had a great trip. Because i am from Denmark, i knew absolutely nothing about football. However, the community college planned a trip to the CLink, to watch the game between the Tampa bay Bucs and the Seahawks. Buccaneers managed to get a 21 point lead over the Seahawks, but the Hawks came back and beat the Buccaneers 27-24 in overtime. I have never experienced anything like it. At this point i didn't know a lot about football, but the atmosphere in the CLink was amazing, and we could definetely hear why the 12th man is the loudest fanbase in the NFL. I have been a huge fan since then, and even though i am back in Denmark, i now no a lot about this amazing sport, and with my gamepass, which by the way is very expensive in Denmark, i can watch every single game from home, and i love it.\nWatching the amazing comeback win against the Bucs at the CLink was the most amazing the i have ever seen, and i will forever be a hawks fan!\nAnd as Russell Wilson would say: ''Go Hawks''",

It's great to show my \"12\" pride out here and fun to see another \"12\" out here every now and then.  It's tough watching their games here; I am under a self-imposed \"media blackout\" on game day until I can catch them on NFL Rewind, which sees me usually watching them late at night.

As a young kid I could care less about wins and losses, but I started to really follow the Hawks in the mid 80's the whole Boz fiasco,  the 8-8 seasons and barely missing the playoffs.  I remember Ken Boehering trying to move the team to Anaheim.  I remember going to games watching  the bust with Rick Mirer. But we had Tez, Jacob, back in the day I also enjoyed Brian Blades Galloway.  I was lucky to be there for the 2005 NFC title game.  I'm a Flight Attendant, so my bucket list is crossed off as I worked a few charter flights.  Meeting the whole team was great, but so was the media, coaches and ownership. It was great to see Max Unger flying his hometown airline",

    "note": "I'm a lifelong Alaskan and a lifelong Seahawks fan. When I was about 5 years old, I'd watch football with my mom, and since she's a very patient teacher, I gradually learned football rules and fell in love with the game. My bedroom became wall-papered with any Seahawks photos & memorobelia I could find, from the cut-out photos from Seahawks calendars, to signed team posters, the Wheaties box with Steve Largent, newspaper layouts. No one could tell the color of paint on my walls - it was all just blue and green action.\n\nWhen the 'Hawks played, I'd get home from church and skip the stairs at lightning speed so I wouldn't miss a second of the game, and if it wasn't on the TV, I'd sit in front of a radio speaker, just as content. At recess, I was one of only two girls who'd play two-hand touch football - I played wide receiver and corner even if I was in a dress. Corner was my favorite position.\n\nEven though I lived in Anchorage, there weren't many Seahawks fans in my classes growing up, so often on Mondays, I'd generally be made fun of for sticking with my team. But I gladly defended with detailed stats and play-by-plays of Seahawks fabulousness even if they loss.\n\nMy senior year, I got a free trip to Seattle, so went with my Grandma to a game against the Broncos, my loathed arch-nemesis. I've been to a few games since and it excites me every time.\n\nSo now to the best part of the story. At the beginning of last season, I told my brother my pick for the Super Bowl: Seahawks vs. Broncos. He became a Broncos fan early on, solely because he knew I couldn't stand them! \n\nOn NFC & AFC championship game day, my brother & I sincerely cheered for each other's teams for the first time. February 2 is my birthday, and I rallied lots of folks to cheer for the 'Hawks and Broncos so I could have my all-time dream Super Bowl match up on my birthday. \n\nOur village of Galena, Alaska is a small, fly-in-only community on the Yukon River. My friends don't care about football really, and I'd not met any Seahawks fans in Galena. So my non-football friends designed an awesome Super Bowl party for me, and folks who could care less about the Broncos or Seahawks made a Seahawks cake, Skittles punch, blue and green foods, wore Beast Mode eye black, blue and green ribbons in their hair and put up with my Skittle throwing and 12th-man shouting in the living room. A friend of mine painted my face for the event. And my brother sent me a crocheted doll in Seahawks uniform that I've named Richard Sherman Pavish Anderson; the doll now travels with me on the plane when I'm on tour. \n\nIt was the BEST birthday ever because of good friends and flawless football by my Seahawks. \n\nSuper Bowl victory over the Broncos on my birthday? I couldn't ask for more.\n\nExcept perhaps a repeat. #GoHawks",

Despite being born in San Francisco, and having lived in St. Louis, when I moved in 2002 and met Jim Zorn's son through soccer, my loyalties to the Seahawks since then have been serious and strong. However, in relocating to Central Iowa, home of many cornfields and few people, I found myself in the minority as a Hawks fan, until I met my friend Sam, ironically from San Francisco, but a die hard Hawks fan. Since then, homework is always on hold on game day, and the two of us cram into our dorm room, watching every play, every week, no exceptions. For us, the Hawks helped us become very close friends, mainly from being the only 12th Men in a world of Bronco and Packer fans. However, on November 16th, the dorm room and computer live stream won't be needed, as the two of us are day tripping it to Kansas City to represent our Hawks at Arrowhead Stadium, something we are both looking forward to anxiously. We may living in the middle of Iowa, but we do our best to rep the 12th Man loud and proud, and hope that we can do that for all of KC to see on November 16th. At least Jim Zorn will be proud.",

Would pour through the TV listings every week, wherever we were, hoping the Seahawks game was going to be on. Finally settled in an area within a 3-hour drive from DC, Baltimore, Philly, Pittsburgh, & NY/NJ. Spent many years insisting to east coast fans that Seattle indeed does still have a team. When we would pour through the JC Penny holiday Catalog, we would look for anything they were offering with a 'Hawks logo on it (slim pickings if you weren't a cowboys or LA raiders fan back then). One year, when calling in the order, the rep. on the line said the only way Penny's would get Seahawks stuff is if they won a Superbowl. This year, the (only) sporting goods store in town actually had Seahawks gear in stock! (for about 10 days before it all sold out). Since the Superbowl victory, when we walk into a place out here in our 'Hawks jerseys, we don't have to beg to put our game on the TV or convince anyone Seattle still has a team. Go Seahawks!!!",

He patiently explains the game to me as I ask every stupid question imaginable, such as, \"How do they get the yellow line to move so quickly?\" 2012 the NY Giants win the Super Bowl! Seattle could care less. I start watching the Hawks. 2013 the Seahawks win the Super Bowl. I watch a city burst with civic pride. I watch departments at the college I work at dress and celebrate. I watch how the spirit of the game brings people together. I am truly touched and in awe of the power of football, beyond the game itself. Now I get it! Go Hawks!",

Then about Cortez Kennedy and Chris Warren. Memories of Steve Largent getting crushed by Mike Harden and then him getting Mike Harden back! AFC West rivalries!! YES!!! Now that is big time / memory-filled football at its best! My heart broke when I heard that Ken Behring was moving the team to L.A. in 1997, so much so, that I flew to Seattle, got a hotel room, and spent several days helping out with the Referendum 48 campaign to keep the Seahawks in Seattle. I have so many lifelong memories from that experience! I got to hang out with Warren Moon and Big Sam Adams, spent some time with the SeaGals cheerleaders, was interviewed by the local media after they got word about my crusade and most proudly, got to meet personally with Paul Allen backstage at Union Station during the 48 celebration! Since that week, I have been fortunate enough to fly out to Seattle for two championship games, one in CLink and one outside as I couldn't get tickets! There is just nothing like Seahawks football! I now have a beloved and wonderful family that has sprung even more Ohio Seahawks faithful! My passion for the Seahawks has garnered many onlookers over the decades.

Every Sunday when the Seahawks are at home my husband and I set our alarm for 5am, and we are in the car by 6am.  We make the 2.5hour drive from Vancouver to Seattle.  We spend the morning with fellow 12's and then head to the game.  When the game is over we get back in the car and make the nearly 3-4hr drive home (longer due to the border wait and traffic).  We never miss a home game!  It's the one day of the week where we can spend the day together uninterrupted and in our favorite place.  When the Seahawks are on the road you can find us in our livingroom with our jerseys and hats on cheering on the boys.   ",

Knowing the importance of home field advantage, I was obviously thrilled. But I also knew that watching the Hawks rip through the playoffs - and doing so at the Clink, no less - was not going to be easy in a city full of transplants and fans of the team that shall remain unnamed. *Cue multiple episodes of intense jealousy over friends and family members living in Seattle, misunderstood outbursts of excitement by members of the DC public, and extreme bitterness at the nearly universal city-wide support of the Denver Broncos.\n\nHowever, it also happened to be the year that the Super Bowl was being played in New York, a mere 4 hours away from DC. So, after Richard Sherman lit the world on fire en route to the Super Bowl, and after spending the entire season celebrating wins from my living room, I spent a small fortune on a bus ride to New York and a ticket to the Super Bowl.\n\nThe rest was history. Sweet, sweet, 43-8 Seahawk's history.",

The Seahawks were a dirty word due to the former divisional rivalry they had held with the Chiefs. That first season I maintained my position. Then, in 2008, I drove up for a Hawks game. I had prided myself in being a Chiefs fan - the best, most fanatical, and loudest fanbase in the NFL - or so I thought. \n\nThat one game was enough. I saw unparalleled support of a team that was on the verge of making some magic happen. I fell for the Hawks hook, like, and sinker. I may still check in on the Chiefs from time to time to see how they're doing, but I couldn't tell you more than two or three of their players. The Hawks have turned my blood from red and gold to blue and green. Go Hawks!",

In elementary school, I remember being teased for remaining a Seahawks fan because each season they would usually end with a losing record. My senior year in high school we finally got to experience the Superbowl, and our state's first professional sports championship appearance since the Sonics lost to the Bulls in the '96 NBA finals. To lose a Superbowl in that fashion was excruciating. And for the refs to come out and apologize for their misconduct added salt to the wound.\n\nAfter a few promising seasons we finally headed back to the NFL main stage and took the throne as World Champions. The resolve of Seattle sports fan base is second to none! Being a Seahawks fan for this long and watching the ups and downs with this franchise has been a wild ride, but well worth it. I moved to Capitol Hill last December and got to party on the streets after we won Superbowl XLVIII and partook in the parade festivities days following the win. I look forward to more Superbowl victories and Seahawks superstars filling the airwaves of local and national media!",

    "note": "I grew up in the Seattle area and spent my youth rooting for the Huskies as they were the only game in town. Seattle got the team after I was in the Army and I followed them until retirement from the military  and moving back to Washington for 6 years in 1992. We followed my my wife's job to Arizona in 1998 and have been here since, but I still follow and root for both the Huskies and Seahawks. Until last year's Superbowl champs, I was starting to worry I would end up like some Cubs baseball fans and never see a champion football team in my lifetime. So I really appreciated the last year's champs. All I ask is they don't take another 38 years to do it again!",

So I decided which ever team got the first win in their history, that team would be my favorite. Once Seattle got that first win in their first season, I have been a faithful Seahawk fan. I lived in the Greater Puget Sound area for 19 years and attended several pre-season and regular season games.\nThe most memorable game was between Denver and Seattle in the Kingdome. The stakes were: the winner went to the playoffs, loser stayed home. Needless to say Seattle that year did not make it. I was in unison with many other fans over a very questionable call during the game.\nThe two greatest moments were when the Seahawks made it to the Super Bowl, twice. I was upset with accounts of the \"Steelers/Officials\" win in the first Super Bowl ever for Seattle.  The most recent trip to the Super Bowl was a most exciting for me, two scores within the first 12 seconds of the first half and again the first 12 seconds of the second half. \nMy only regret is that my wife was not by my side to cheer her Broncos on and make Super Bowl Sunday an event like no other. My hope is that there will be other Super Bowl trips and most importantly, Seattle will stop being the training ground for athletes that get traded to other teams and do well for them!",

    "note": "We've been Hawk fans from the very beginning. We grew up in Snoqualmie Valley, lived in Redmond when we celebrated getting our own NFL team! We were on the 10 year wait list for season tickets when we finally got in! Our first seats in Kingdome were in end zone, had to sit with -ugh- Raider & Bronco fans! Over time we worked our way around to better seats, endured some pretty AWFUL seasons. I took opportunity to teach my daughter & son about football since my husband wouldn't go to games with me! When new stadium was built, we'd been assigned terrible seats, so I went immediately to ticket office & were able to upgrade to Club Seats, treated like royalty! We were offered use of Club area during non-game times, so we arranged our son's WEDDING in the Clubhouse on day Hawks were playing in Arizona .... in fact TODAY Nov 10 is their 12 year anniversary! Of course, I had insisted on having the game playing on all monitors in Clubhouse Restaurant, without sound, during reception. Our guests were thrilled to experience the brand new stadium .... which not have happened if I hadn't been such a diehard fan all these years!  We had to give up our season tickets in 2004 after we had to move to southern WA, but my passion has never waned!  I'd always claimed that \"the year we'd give up our season tix is the year we'll probably go to Superbowl\"..... which then happened! I felt so alienated from Seattle & the Hawk scene .. until this past Year of the Hawk & discovered all the fans in this \"Portland area\" wearing their Seahawk gear everywhere! Instead of people on the street simply saying \"hello\" or \"how are ya\" they say GO HAWKS! I love it!!!",

    "note": "I grew up in Seattle and was always a big football fan.  My mother and I went to the first Seahawks game, a preseason game against the 49er's her favorite team.  I had season tickets and took my neices and nephews to the games every year when they were young, until I moved away from Washington state in 1999, my family kept my tickets for many years but gave them up in 2004.  I have followed the Seahawks even though I live in the midwest and have really enjoyed the fact that the Seahawks are now in the NFC and play here in Chicago Minneapolis and Green Bay.  Now my nieces have their own children and are raising them as Seahawks fans and I do my best to support their efforts.  I had the a wonderful day last February when I ended up on a flight to Seattle through Denver on Super Bowl Sunday.  I flew in all of my Seahawks attire and had a great time watching the first half in a Brew Pub in the Denver airport. I got to watch the 2nd half on a flight full of Seahawks fans and got to Seattle in time for the after game celebrations.  While my visit to Washington State that day was to visit my dying father, I rejoice in the fact that he got to see the Seahawks win the Super Bowl and I got to speak with him about the wonderful game before he died.  I  work with terrific group of people that despite the fact that none of them are Seahawks fans, decorated my office with all kinds of Seahawks posters and memorabilia which I still have up today.  While I am hoping for a repeat this season no mater what the outcome; I will always be a Seahawks fan and have been since their humble beginning!  \nGo Hawks!!!",

When my family moved to Southern California from New Jersey in 1965, I had a hard time getting excited about any of the West Coast teams.  After graduating from high school, I attended Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Jim Zorn attended Cal Poly Pomona – the two schools competed against one another in football and I saw him play during that time. When Seattle got the Seahawks franchise, and Zorn became the quarterback, I decided to throw all of my support behind this brand-new team in the NFL.  I am proud to say that I have been a loyal fan since the very beginning, and I always will be!  ",

I was only maybe 13 at the time, and thought Seattle Seahawks nad a cool name and I liked the helmet decal design! I used to listen out for games on the AFRTS Europe radio on Sunday evenings, hoping for a Seahawks game. I have stayed loyal ever since, around 30 years now. Finally in 2008 I achieved my dream of going to Seattle, and attending a game (vs Rams) at Qwest field, as it was known then. Had a stadium tour as well, and of course the club shop. Finally on Jan'14 the ultimate dream came true, as we won our first Superbowl. I will stay loyal till the day I die. GO SEAHAWKS!!",

Clad in my oversized Steve Largent jersey u would steal from my brother each Sunday morning, ice cold cup of my juice of choice, and the big screen turned all the way up. There was no way you could get me away from that TV..not even the best Saturday morning cartoons were as good as SEATTLE SEATTLEHAWK  (is what I called them) Sunday football. I won my first pair of tickets to a game by guessing the correct number of jelly beans in a jar when I was 7. My dad just as proud as could be escorted me to my first seattle seattlehawks game. We would go on to win and just like that the crowd thousands of other people sharing my interest I WAS HOOKED. 20 years later...I'm just as hard core. My right arm fully sleeved in Seattle tattoos, my wardrobe consisting of mostly blur, green and gray, down to my hair permanently dyed blue and green most of the football season. I truly love the Seattle Seahawks. They've made for some of the happiest memories I'll ever have. I attend at least one or two games every year and look forward to one day returning to the Emerald City so I can be at every home game. Good or bad. I'll always be a 12th man.

We all moved to Germany in 1979, but we'd get Seattle papers and later VCR-taped games to keep up.  From Tacoma to Frankfurt, West Germany to Lubbock, TX, to Arizona to law school and a law practice in San Diego, CA, the Hawks have always been my team!  Go Hawks!!",

    "note": "I wanted to be just like Curt Warner when I was a young buck growing up in Salt Lake City, Utah.  #28 was plastered all over my walls and the SEAHAWKS were my team baby.  So I ended up moving to L.A. in 2000 and decided to start a Seahawks Bar out here in the SoCal.  So I did just that at a little place called the backstage bar and grill.  Started that 2006 and it's a place of destination.  When people come to L.A. from Seattle, they come here to rage with their fellow 12's...it's an experience!!!  It's packed every Sunday for the past 3 years with half the crowd being new peeps every week with some of the older peeps holding out because there was a worry that you wouldn't get in as the line would be down the block.  I also with my friend Travis Platt flew a GO HAWKS 12's banner over the last game we played at Candlestick Park last year, just to give our boys a spark during that away game against our #1 RIVAL.  I feel some sort of way about the 49ers.  Mama Sherman is the Chunky Soup \"Mama\" via a campaign I start September 2013 to get her recognized by Chunky Soup and to get her and Richard as the next \"Mama's Boy\"...needless to say, it worked man. And they cast me in the commercial as the Feathered Defender.  Oh yeah Baby...it's been a wild ride and the ride aint over!!! SEAHAWKS for LIFE!!!  Can I get an GO HAWKS!!! That reminds me, time for a prayer and the 12th Man Commandments:                  12th Man NFL Prayer\nIf it's NFL Sunday Football... then it's time to start the day off right with a NFL prayer!!! Whether you're a 12th Man fan or lesser thereof, the NFL is worthy of a few words.\nBow your heads as Deacon Jones leads us in prayer.\nIt's NFL Sunday PEOPLE!!! WAKE UP!!!!!!! WAKE UP I SAID!!!\nGive praise to those that have made all of this possible, and breathed life into and onto man kind when we were amongst our darkest of ages. WAKE UP I say, and glorify their names people...why it's a glorious bunch, and indeed they are a glorious bunch. Say Vince Lombardi's name loudly and clearly...holla Papa Bear Halas's name in praise...scream out the names Tex Schramm and Lamar Hunt, for they merged two religions together to make a more perfect one...shout out the name Pete Rozelle, for he was THE most perfect Shepard...yell Steve Sabol's name, for he keep beautiful records of thy religion as it unfolded. All of these deities have blessed us with this wonderful religion... THE NFL!!!...praise them!!!! Look up to the heavens and know that Vince Lombardi is casting a smile 6 feet in your direction, and surely, it's not a dream...Yeah Yeah!!! \nAmen\nCan I get a Go Hawks?\nCan I get a GO HAWKS?\n-Cedric James Morris           12th Man Commandments\n\n1. Always stay completely and absolutely sucka free.\n2. Never kiss your bicep, left nor right.\n3. After each and every conversation say Go Hawks.\n4. No matter where you are on Game Day... Be loud!!!!\n5. If you go to Starbucks or any place were they ask for your name, tell them Go Hawks.  That way when you order is ready they'll call out...GO HAWKS!!! \n6. After each and every Beast Mode touchdown a skittle must be consumed, thrown, or the bag shaken.\n7. On Friday's you must wear blue and type or say Happy Blue Friday to another Seahawks fan.\n\nExamples:\nIf you see a 49er fan on the elevator you're about to get on, wait for the next one...you just stayed sucka free.\n\nIf you're working out in the gym, and you barely squeezed out that last curl, resist the temptation and just drop the dumb bell...you just avoided kissing your bicep.\n\nIf you're in a elevator with one other person at 5:25 pm on Monday and the game is about to start, turn to he or she and start yelling Rus-sell Wil-son chants while staring at he or she.  When the elevator hits the ground level, say, \"Go Hawks\"...you have now met the LOUD requirement while also satisfying the GO HAWKS statute.\n\nYou are now LOUD and PROUD my friend.\nGO HAWKS!!!!",

In 2007 my husband mentioned that we should do something special to celebrate our 15th anniversary. I suggested we go see my Seahawks play. With his jaw dropped open he quickly agreed, and even though we lost that day I will never forget the level of excitement in that stadium, the noise, and passion of the fans there reverberating up through the floors. I want to go back so bad. I love being a 12th man  so proud of my Seahawks, and oh so proud to be part of the 12th fan nation.  ",

At that time I did'nt knew NFL that well, only a little because of Morten Andersen. Well I saw all the Alexander videos and quiet fast I became a fan of him and the sport in general. I decided to follow him all the way into NFL and support that team he will end up going to in the Draft. In 2002 I would say, that I was a true fan. I knew the rules, saw the games online and eventually bought NFL GamePass, which I've been using for several of years now. I've been in Seattle and CenturyLink Field once and hope to get there soon again. I'm also managing a Danish Seahawks fansite on Facebook for a few years now. We currently have 359 likes, which does'nt sounds as much, but it's a small country and Seahawks are, unfortunately, not that popular over here. It's more 49'ers, Packers and Patriots. If you want to know the fansite on Facebook, you can follow the link here: https://www.facebook.com/SeattleSeahawksDenmark\n\nGO HAWKS! (Russell Wilson style) ",

My Grandma Barb and Aunt Terry used to sew and bedazzle every single SeaGal uniform in the 1990's and I used to try them on as a little girl, always wishing I would grow up to be a SeaGal just like Aunt Shannon. Before my Aunt Terry's passing four years ago, she did hair and makeup for the SeaGals, as did my cousin Susan (who still does). \n\nAlthough I live in Los Angeles, I continue to represent my Seahawks down here with my fellow LA 12's and will always feel immense pride in my family's involvement with our incredible NFL franchise.\n\nGO SEAHAWKS!! \n\n",

I grew up in Southern California, but didn't form any football allegiances until the early 2000s. At that time, Matt Hasselbeck and Shaun Alexander were young up and comers. I started researching the team and the culture, and immediately knew I wanted to be a 12th Man. I've gone to a Seattle home game every year since 2006, and the 12 Flag flies high over my home in Orange, CA.",

My father, a European old world guy, wasn't much into football and certainly never took me to Jets or Giants games. They played in Jersey in the winter and we're sold out anyway. So my allegiance stuck. I have followed the team feverishly ever since and have seen games in Seattle and elsewhere and have been to both Super Bowls. My patience, though often tested, finally paid off last season. Go Hawks!",

    "note": "It was a typical day in College Station, Texas; I did some studying, a little drinking.\n \nMy buddies Zach and Michael invited me to the friend’s apartment for the Dallas Cowboys game.  (Side note: From birth, I was raised to be a Cowboys fan.  It was just as important to my family as me being raised Catholic.)\n \nLittle did I know, that day, that game, that feeling, would change my life forever.\n \nIt was a so-so game until the 2nd quarter, granted Emmitt Smith had potential to break Walter Payton’s rushing record; then quarterback Trent Dilfer suffered an achilles injury.  He would not return.\n \nMatt Hasselbeck relieved Trent.  He went on, 12 for 19, 131 yards, and 1 INT.  Not bad for a Boston College kid who just got thrown into a game against one of the best teams in the NFL.  Mike Holmgren stated after the game “He is a player that gets excitable, but he played well within himself today…”\n \nShaun Alexander (soon to be Pro Bowler and on the cover of Madden 2007) rushed 23 times for 58 yards.  His 2-yard touchdown run made it 7-0 with 12 seconds left in the first half and a 5 yard TD run made it 14-7 early in the 4th quarter.\n\nA hit by Darren Woodson on Dallas' Darrell JAckson almost made me piss my pants.  Knocked the CRAP outta him and I, till this day, cannot get that image out of my head.  Why would I want to?!  Go Hawks! \n \nEmmitt Smith tied the game with a 1 yard TD run, marking his 150th career rushing score, at the end of his record-breaking drive.\n \nSeattle’s ensuing drive went 72 yards, to set up Rian Lindell’s game winning kick.\n \nI was speechless.  For some strange reason I was completely enthralled.  I had a feeling expand inside of me and I was just taken back.\n \nHasselbeck, the golden boy from B.C., and the Alabama RB, Shaun Alexander, along with what some would deem as a below average defense and a lacking O line and WR core, pulled it out against some of the world’s elite!\n \nThen thereafter the game was a concrete memory.  Then in 2005, Lofa Tatupu was selected 45th overall in the second round by the Seahawks, out of (Pete Carroll’s) USC, and I was sold.  The addition of Deon Branch and Nate Burleson made all the more worth while for me!\n \nI have been, and forever will be, a 12th man flag flyin’, loud and proud, win, lose, or tie, Seattle Seahawks fan until I die, and beyond.\n \nWith this story all I have to say is “Stay true to your team, and never give up!” God Bless and Go Hawks!",

I've been a long distance 12th Man ever since.",

When they would here that I liked the SEAHAWKS they be like \"WTF SEAHAWKS\" :/  Yep, it was strange to them but I was a rare fan in enemy territory. Never did I go astray on my team nor will I ever in my life. I shall stick to my team till the day I die. Funny how times have changed. It's all other teams that are now looking from the outside in. Seahawks are the team all others want to imitate but can not duplicate. Fans want to be like us 12's in many aspects but they will never reach our ground shaking decibels . It feels good to be a 12 these days and all I can say to all other fans out there is GO SEAHAWKS!!!!  SUPERBOWL 48 CHAMPIONS \"BOOM, IN YOUR FACE\"",

    "note": "I moved to Seattle from Dallas in 1986 and it took a while to become a fan, but I didn't become a fanatic until the 2013-14 season, when I started following every game. I don't consider myself a bandwagon fan, however b/c I've never lost faith in my team, even in the darkest of seasons. But when I started following the players Facebook pages, I realized what a wonderful and talented group of guys we have in Seattle. Russell Wilson is the most inspiring man, taking time out from his busy schedule to visit kids at Children's Hospital and being such a kind and generous soul. I love his attitude and I love to watch him give interviews b/c he's genuinely friendly. He's one of the few athletes who will greet the media before answering questions. Most just go up to the microphone and start talking.He's so positive and upbeat, even after a loss and he jsut focuses on starting again, taking the blame for himself. But when it's a win, he won't take the credit, he says it's a team effort. He really impressed me when he was interviewed after the Superbowl on David Letterman. David was trying relentlessly to get Russell to say something negative about Peyton Manning and Wilson showed extraordinary class in saying only positive things about his opponent. I love that Richard Sherman, Doug Baldwin, Earl Thomas and Derek Coleman all have charities in their names. We are blessed in Seattle to have such wonderful players and even if they don't win another Superbowl this year, they are still champions in my eyes. Go Hawks!",

When we'd visit family in California we'd always go to games as there weren't any pro teams in NW. I was excited when Seattle got the Seahawks! I have followed the Hawks from their beginning. Loved watching Jim Zorn throw to the great Steve Largent and his exciting catches. I have followed them through all the good and bad years. It's fun to finally have a great team and players to follow! Love the Hawks! I believe we are on a winning streak all the way to the Super Bowl again! \n",

The reason was I fell in love with their Native American totem style logo and I have family who live up in Lacey, WA who would send me Seahawks gear because back before the internet, that was the only way to get all the cool new stuff. I saw 1 game in the Kingdome when I was little, but I've since traveled up to see 5 games, 1 game in SF (2008-last time we won in SF) and 1 preseason game. I love the Hawks, always have, always will! Cheers to many more years of amazing Seahawks football!",

    "note": "Well it is a long story I will attempt to beak down to a short segment. As long as I can remember I have been a fan of the Hawks, from before I could walk I was cheering for my team along with my family. I remember when my pops used to take me to watch them practice we would watch every game and even spend my aunties 50 birthday in the sky box at the game, gone through many changes in the team but through all those seasons the team was always the same. I even remember being so excited for the super bowl agents the Steelers where the referees really did steal the game (not to mention all my money I bet on the game I had saved that year) even though we were defeated it gave me hope that gave me hope that our team had finely got the formula for success, how ever 2008 I had to move to Alaska because of circumstances out of my control and I was not able to make to the super bowl this year but even though I could not be with them in person I made sure Alaska knew the 12th man was present and as energetic as always. I just want to say thank you to the players for giving the children and even adults some one to look up too!",

I also enjoy a weekly tease of my friends in New England (all of them sickly \"Patriots\" fans) who name their babies and dogs \"Brady\" and who believe that nothing short of a Super Bowl Victory each year and every year = total failure.)   If you please, my dear Seahawks, on behalf of my long lost home, again please just do what you did last week to AZ and dispatch SF from the playoff pot as early as possible.  Also, if I may be granted a second wish, I could use just one more hologram of victory for my brother (who died last year at age 52, of cancer, before he could see if the Seahawks actually make it all the way).  But whatever happens, win or lose (tho preferably win), my brother, and I, will always be there, patiently waiting.  ",

I came up in the days of Largent, Raible, etc., and distinctly remember the excitement in our living room in the rainy falls and winters when the Hawks would play. Nobody beats the fans of Seattle. We stand by our Hawks in the highs and lows, and we could never be accused of being fair-weather fans because, unfortunately in Seattle, fair weather is a rare commodity! I feel so lucky to have found the amazing group of 12s here in SoCal at The Backstage Bar; it's a bit of home away from home. GO HAWKS!!",

My friends were making a big deal of guy's being \"bandwagon jumpers\" so I went the opposite way and became a Seahawks fan for life, and believe me it's not easy on the east coast. My favorite thing about being a Hawks fan NOW is being accused of being a BANDWAGON JUMPER after 35 years!!! My least favorite was having the Flu during the Superbowl last year , have you ever tried to scream at the TV with a 102 fever, but I was still in heaven,I waited a long time for that!",

Respect Paul Allens ownership and vision in bringing Pete Carroll on board. I thought he was an exceptional coach at SC, read his book and feel he is the perfect coach for the Hawks!

    "note": "I grew up in San Francisco and a huge 49er fan rooting for Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, and all the Super Bowl teams through the 80s and early 90s. I moved to Seattle in 1991. When the Hawks joined the NFC West in 2002 and got to play the Niners in the new stadium, I asked a friend who lives here - and also an avid Niner fan - to go to the game which was a week away at the time. We needed a pair of tickets, but the game was sold out. The Seahawks ticket sales person said jokingly that the only way to get into the game was if we bought season tickets. Being die hard fans, we bought a pair of season tickets. We figured we'd go to the game and sell the other tickets. The Niners won that game, but we didn't sell the other tickets. We ended up going to other home Hawk games and justified rooting for the Seahawks since they were our home town team. We cheered in lukewarm fashion that year but had fun in the great atmosphere of Seahawk Stadium. The following year, we figured we'd hang on to the tickets and go to the Niner game again and maybe some other games. We ended up going to all the home games. In fact, we slowly supported the Hawks more and more. That second year, we cheered for the 49ers but it was difficult given we had been cheering for the Seahawks too. The 3rd year of our season tickets, we more or less cheered for the Hawks over the Niners when that game came around. It was kind of like cheering against your best friend so you could cheer for your own kid. Fast forward to today, and we're both die hard 12s. I went to the Super Bowl last year with my son and had the best time that will last a lifetime. And my buddy who originally bought tickets with me upgraded his seats to the club level. \n\nGo Hawks!",

Didn't understand the game much at this point but found it fun to watch with pop's. The years past by the seahawks became a Sunday choice of myself and my cousins we pretend as most kids did we were the home town Hawks playing in the kingdom and it was forth and goal and dornik would score the game winner. Year's went by in the AFC West. And some great games were played. Always disliked the broncos and seen some great games live in the dome. Playoffs came and went would be kinda shakey then.And then the worst case scenario ever the broncos won the super bowl. Heart sank then they did it again. Life could not be much worse always thought we were the better team. Then there was this tool bag named ken. Any true hawks fan knows his last name. Tryed to move the team Seattle said please don't go. Thank God they didn't. Fast forward past the black out year's you know they were the ones that you could not see the game on local televisions. Fast forward again it's 2005 Mat is are QB Shawn run's it and the refs mess it all up heart sank to much to take worst thing ever. 2008 Dad passes away bad year then Montana here I am. One year I don't watch. 2010 settle in got married find out the wife really don't watch much football. Start trying to watch but go figure it is broncos on TV. That does not work. So thanks to internet access and smart phone start watching it on just a fake football field with the play's wrote out kinda lame but I still believe. Playoffs 2012. Russell Wilson does something that has not been done in a very long time has a come from behind win against the bear's looks like magic then it is over the next week. Never before had I stated how good they had looked Even though we lost it seemed alright. Then something happens the TV Start's showing seahawks game's and life is awesome in great fall's. Keep thinking inside how great it would be to meet the broncos in the super bowl. Progress on to the playoffs life is great here we home field advantage two games and we are there. Things look shakey then a miracle my man the sherminator tips a ball Malcolm picks it and a prayer is answered all these years later seahawks and the broncos face off in the big dance. The rest is history. Stepped out side with tear in my eyes look up to the sky and say guess what dad we did we won the super bowl. Thank you seahawks you are and will always be my home team Go Hawks",

    "note": "The NFL gained popularity in the mid 80's and as a 16 year old life was a little dull on Sunday evenings in the Autumn and Winter months. In those days we only had 4 TV channels and at 6pm, 2 programmes were about religion and the 3rd was about money - subjects that were not particularly interesting to me. The 4th however was a highlights show of American Football and I was instantly fascinated not only by the game, but of America!\nThe quick decision making, the attention to detail, it was all black and white. No 'grey' to waste time arguing about..... and this was the country, not just the game!\nTo my delight I found that a few of my college friends also suffered the same boredom on sunday evenings and they were hooked too.... but maybe not with the same fascination with the country however.\nBut what about a team?!\nAll the guys had got theirs - obvious choices such as New England and Dallas, but I wanted to be different and so in 1 class of History Modern World (I remember the moment till this day :)) I scanned down a list of all the teams until I stopped at the Seattle Seahawks.\nSeee at le.... Just the sound of it got me! \"Seeeaattle\". That was it, that was my team and so the love affair, the fanaticism and the inevitable stress of following the Seattle Seahawks began.\nFor the next 8 years or so I only had a weekly highlights show and the odd live game to keep me going visually, however it was Armed Forces Radio that can best describe how much I was hooked on the NFL. \nThe quality of sound back then was awful.... 2 minutes of crackle, fuzz and maybe even an Indian radio station but then I would get a minute of \"Westwood One\" as I think it was back then and oh was it beautiful. Listening to real live scores and action as it happened. It gives me goosebumps to think how I would here if Seattle had scored a touchdown and even win. (As you know there wasn't many in the early 90's)\nI can still remember listening to my first live Seattle game on AFN against the Bengals at 2am on Monday or Tuesday morning in 1990 - we won 31-16 and remember knocking over my midnight orange juice all over my stereo speaker in jubilation!\nThe best or worst example (however you want to look at it) of my fanaticism was when some years later we had a power cut in the home one winters evening, whilst Seattle were live on AFN playing the Raiders, and so rather than miss anything, I proceeded to sit and listen in my car from 2 till 4am on a snowy winters morning. I took a blanket because I didn't want to keep the engine running with the heater on and maybe wake the neighbours!\nI won't bore you with all that has happened since but suffice it to say I have been fortunate enough to attend in person both NFC Championship Games in Seattle, 2006 and 2014 and witnessed the Hawks comeback against the Texans, in Houston last year.\nWhilst that doesn't sound a great deal to probably a lot of my fellow peers, its because I have used a lot of my travel time to try and see a game at every NFL stadium and with my love of America, every baseball stadium! Altogether I'm up to 25 total stadiums.\nSeattle is an amazing city and a brilliant franchise to follow and I am immensly proud to be associated with it.\nYes more recently there have been some fantastic highs but those early years of losing somehow made my support even stronger and I whilst I may not get so down about a loss as I used to, it still is an amazing feeling getting fired up for every tackle, catch and run the guys make. \nThank you for changing my life all those years ago and giving me so many wonderful moments to treasure.",

CenturyLink is the most memorable and my favourite stadium experience of all time, I've witnessed Soccer finals, Rugby finals but nothing in sport could compare with the noise, energy and pure volume that is brought by the 12s for our Seattle Seahawks. \n\nEverything from Touchdown Experience zone from 10am in the morning, facepainting, chanting, sharing stories and engaging with all the other Seattle faithful put not only the Seahawks but also CenturyLink Field at the top of any sports event I’ve ever attended.\n\nOur trip didn’t finish there as we started the long road to Santa Clara to follow the Seattle Seahawks to face the 49ers at Levi’s Stadium on Thanksgiving Thursday, we witnessed another brutal performance from the Hawks and their LOB defence! It was amazing to see so many 12s make the journey to California and no matter where you are whether it be in the Pacific NorthWest or California, 12s stick together and root for the Hawks. \n\nOur trip was topped off by being able to meet not only my favourite Seahawk but also a gift to take home in which Doug Baldwin and Bobby Wagner signed my hat to take back across the Atlantic for life.\n\nI wish to return to CenturyLink Field in the very near future and will do my best to spread the good word of the 12s and cheer on the Hawks to Superbowl Glory in Arizona!\n\nGO HAWKS.

    "note": "I moved to Western Washington in 1976 and one of the first things I learned about my new home was that there was a brand new football franchise in Seattle. Having been a lover of football since my high school cheer leading days, I immediately became a fan. I loved watching Jim Zorn and Steve Largent in action, but just as entertaining was Efrem Herrera's kicking and the trick plays the team often tried. (It seemed like they lost most of the time anyway, so why not?)  In the early eighties the team started winning. My husband loves telling about the time in December, 1984 when we got married.  Everyone was inside the church ready to start the ceremony, but they couldn't find me, the bride.  I was sitting in the car listening to the radio broadcast of the Seahawks playing the Raiders!  (They did get me inside eventually.  We got married, and the Seahawks won!)\n We moved to Florida in 1989 and stayed up late on work nights on the rare occasions the Seahawks were broadcast in the east.  I was watching them on Monday Night Football in Florida in '89 the night Largent retired.  We were so homesick we returned to Western Washington in 1990 and resumed following the Seahawks without missing a beat by buying season tickets shortly after.  There were some very lean years for the Hawks in the 90s, and I got tired of people saying, \"Oh, I'm sorry\" or \"too bad\" when I said I was a Seahawk fan.  I admit, there were a few times when I said I was going to \"swear off forever\"; but I just couldn't stop loving my Seahawks.\n  In 2005, I told my husband (and others), \"I just want the Seahawks to go to the Super Bowl before I die\".  Of course, they did go that season and that made me a little nervous.  When they lost to Pittsburgh, I changed my bargain with God to, \"I just want the Seahawks to WIN the Super Bowl before I die\".  And last year, they did.  Maybe it's dumb to have tears come to your eyes when your team wins, but I admit my eyes got leaky when my beloved Hawks became Super Bowl champions in 2013.  It really was a highlight of my life that I'll never forget, no matter HOW long I live!  I'm glad I stuck with the home team through good seasons and bad, no matter how painful the losses were at times, so I can say I never gave up on the Seattle Seahawks.  They have made me proud, not only on the field but for the work they do in the community and the example of integrity they set for the new generation of fans.  Go Hawks!",

    "note": "Born in Seattle, lived there when the Hawks were born. I was lucky to go to several games in the Kingdome.  Enjoyed the days of Jack Patera, Efren Herrera, Jim Zorn, Steve Largent, Dan Doornink, and then later Shaun Alexander and Hasselbeck. SB XL: end zone pass interference? low block called on Hasselbeck?  that was a fantastic season though. Then, 2013, I cried at the end of NFC championship, jumping up and down like a wildman in Portland after the game ending interception. After the SB win, I didn't stop wearing my Hawks shirt and hat for a week.  Finally, I just had to wash the shirt.  We did have a big SB party - if Bronco's fans showed up (they didn't) they would have been allowed to listen to game via radio in the backyard, and had scheduled times of being allowed to the food table. Ha!  I've rooted for the Hawks while living in Seattle (of course), Berkeley (took lots of heat from Niner's fans there), Philadelphia (had to break a 9 yo boy's heart once, when I told him I would root for the Hawks over the Eagles), and now from Portland, where thankfully, I have again found like minded fans!  I wore my Hawks hat in the presence of my mother-in-law this past summer, and she was amazed at how many people exchanged with me a \"go Hawks\" greeting. But, true fans understand that!  It is a common bond!  The Hawks current group - what an inspiration. From the hard knocks of early life, to his current success, Sherman highlights the value of a loving protective family to get him out of a hard childhood.  I love Wilson's trademark \"why not us?\" phrase in applying it to my own personal goals (e.g. my first Sea to PDX bike ride the past summer!).  Earl Thomas preaching teamwork and just having fun, really applies, I think, to making my own family dynamics succeed (wife, 3 kids).  Also, it is heartwarming to me to see my love for the Seahawks be passed down to my kids. Their favorite sports shirts are their Russel Wilson and Sherman Tee-shirts!  Someday, I look forward to coming up to Seattle and taking the family to a game!  The kids really want to go someday.  That day will come, when budget and time allows. Until then, we do have fun watching the games on TV, when we can (i.e. not attending to their own sports games). Go Hawks!",

    "note": "I grew up in Yakima, Washington watching the Seahawks of the late 1980's and early 1990's.  I remember going to my first and only Seahawks game while I still lived in Washington, as a preseason game against Vinny Testaverde and the Jets in the Kingdom and loved every second of the atmosphere and game!  My family moved to California in 1997 where I wasn't able to watch very many Seahawks games until my dad bought the Sunday Ticket package when I was a senior in high school.  My love of the Hawks was renewed and when I went off to College at UC Davis I continued to catch games when I could between my job and school work.  When I was done with college and became a teacher and was able to focus every Sunday on the Hawks and haven't missed watching a game since the 2005 Season.  I have also decorated my classroom in Elk Grove, California with Seahawks flags, Penates, newspaper clippings and posters to the dismay of my students who are primarily 49er and Raider fans.    Since the 2005 I have also been able to attend a handful of games because my parents moved back to Washington that year and when I visit for Thanksgiving or Christmas I get to catch a Seahawks game as well.  One of my greatest Seahawks memories came last year when I was able to visit my older brother in New York, who is also a die-hard Seahawks fan, and catch the best game of our lives, Super Bowl XLVIII.

I was a high school cheerleader & knew all the rules but never bothered to watch a single game. Anyways, we moved here, got invited to my husband's new coworker's house for a Superbowl party & so I went since I had no friends & nothing else to do. Oh, by the way, I was pregnant with my 1st son but he wasn't due for 2 months. So I actually sat down & watched the entire game & got so \"excited\" that I broke my water! My son was born early (he's as healthy as a horse now :) And so I have been a faithful fan since! Unfortunately, my 8 yr old Ian likes to use this story as an excuse as to why he is ALWAYS so excited & crazy when we watch football. Go Hawks :)",

Since, we've been trough hard time between the end of Holmgren and the Pete erea, but it worth it. Last year I took a day off to my office to be able to watch the Superbowl game (in France, the game is in the middle of the night). I was so confident that it was our year, that I warned my boss like almost 2 months before that I won't work this particular Monday. I did the same this year, and I hope the story will be repeated.

However, in the mean time, I was able to obtain tickets so my son and I could watch the Hawks from a season ticket holder who lived in New York. His reasoning for having season tix: \"So I can see the Seahawks if they ever make the playoffs.\" We were able to get to a couple games until they did indeed make the playoffs under Holmgren. Having Holmgren be the coach made for an easy transition for my son and I since we had enjoyed the turn-around that he brought to GB. Experiencing the rise and then disappointment in SB XL, we were still hooked and have enjoyed the ride. I've always been a proponent of defense. My signature on seahawks.net is \"If they don't score, you can't lose.\" When I coached, this was my favorite coachism. The Hawks have definitely proven that to be true. My son, and 2 year-old grandson, and I often watch the Hawks together as we did again last night. After his dad and grandpa cheer  at the TV, my grandson knows it's time for high fives all around. Go Hawks. ",

I love the Pacific Northwest and the traditional art of the First Nation people there. The original Seahawk emblem resonated with me from the first time I saw it.\nWhen I returned to Vermont I discovered that being a Seahawks fan could be a bit lonely. I spent 8 years tending bar in a number of establishments, some that could have been templates for the movie Roadhouse.\nIt was not uncommon for sports discussions to grow in volume and intensity to the verge of physicality.\nI could often defuse such situations by slipping into the gathering and loudly exclaiming \"Hey, how about those Seahawks...!\"\nThe results were usually puzzled expressions or blank stares followed by someone muttering \"What's a Seahawk?\"\nI've been a fan for nearly 40 years, and my Seahawks have gone from unknown to unstoppable.\nGo Hawks!",

My favorite player was Steve Largent and I had a framed poster of him on my wall that I received as a Christmas present from my Grandad.  I was unable to watch many Seattle games but we would get the USA today on the weekends to read about my team across the country.  I traveled to Seattle in 2005 and toured the stadium and went to see them win against the Bears in the club level.  It remains my favorite vacation.  I have been trying to move to Seattle since my trip.  Being able to share your passion with the other people in the city is a wonderful experience.  I now live in New Orleans and still represent the Seahawks whenever I am able. The time spent with my Grandfather talking about Seattle are some of my most treasured memories",
