    "_cvlqs": "From distillery website: This medium to full bodied bourbon presents a classic profile of vanilla, caramel and cherry on the nose - rich and compelling. Sweet, smooth corn combined with brown sugar/maple syrup and oak is balanced with a notable spice contributed by the higher than normal rye content. The finish is beautifully long with notes of buttery oak, toffee, and again the cherries make an appearance."
